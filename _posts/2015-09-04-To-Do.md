Thoughts in no particular order.

- Restrict configuration variables to a specified subset, or to only those that already exist in the YAML file.
- A better way of dealing with multi-level variables - i.e. nested arrays, hashes etc.
- Write standalone tests for the 'Status' class - right now it is tested at 100% by the application tests though would probably be good to have dedicated tests too
- Check Windows compatibility. Certainly at least the RSpec tests will fail since there are issues with FakeFS on Windows. Should be ok as a production Gem though (TBC)
- Add other file formats for storing the configuration - XML? (Yuk!)
- Document properly on a dedicated website with full example usage and help (ongoing).
