Currently Confoog will not allow 'nested' configuration types, however each variable can be an array or hash so multiple settings can be recorded for each variable and accessed (for a hash) by `settings[variable][hash_key]` or array using `settings[array].each`. In other words, treat the return from `settings[var]` as the type it contains. See examples below.

By default, each time a configuration variable is created or changed the file on disk will be updated with this addition or change. If you intend to make a lot of consecutive changes or do not want the small performance hit of this, pass `autosave: false` as a parameter to #new, or set it false using the #autosave accessor.

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'confoog'

settings = Confoog::Settings.new
settings[:var] = value
settings[:array] = [1, 2, 3, 4]
settings[42] = "Meaning of life"
settings[:urls] = ["https://www.mywebsite.com", "https://www.anothersite.com/a/page.html"]

settings[:urls].each do |url|
  puts url
end
# https://www.mywebsite.com
# https://www.anothersite.com/a/page.html
# => ["https://www.mywebsite.com", "https://www.anothersite.com/a/page.html"]

settings[:dont_exist]
# => nil

a_variable = 50
settings[a_variable] = {:one => "for the money", :two => "for the show", :three => "to get ready"}
settings[50]
# => {:one=>"for the money", :two=>"for the show", :three=>"to get ready"}
settings[50][:two]
# => "for the show"

settings.quiet = true # squelch any error or status messages to console

settings.autosave = false # disable autosave if it has been enabled with #new or #autosave

settings.save # save all current parameters to the YAML file

settings.load # load the settings from YAML file.
{% endhighlight %}

Confoog will also take several optional parameters on creation, for example to specify the default config file and location.

{% highlight ruby %}
settings = Confoog::Settings.new(location: '/home/myuser', filename: '.foo-settings')
{% endhighlight %}

There are other optional flags or variables that can be passed on creation:

{% highlight ruby %}
# Should a missing configuration file be created or not
create_file: true | false

# Specify an optional prefix before any error messages
prefix: 'My Application'

# Should we avoid outputting errors to the console? (ie in a GUI app)
quiet: true | false

# Should we automatically load the configuration file when the class is created?
autoload: true | false

# Should we automatically save the configuration file when a variable is created or changed?
autosave: true | false
{% endhighlight %}

If any of these are not specified, Confoog will use the following defaults :

{% highlight ruby %}
location: '~/'
filename: '.confoog'
create_file: false
prefix: 'Configuration'
quiet: false
autoload: false
autosave: true
{% endhighlight %}

Confoog will set the following error constants which will be returned in the `.status[:errors]` variable as needed :

{% highlight ruby %}
ERR_NO_ERROR = 0 # no error condition, command was succesfull
ERR_FILE_NOT_EXIST = 1 # specified configuration file does not exist
ERR_CANT_CREATE_FILE = 2 # cannot create the requested configuration file
ERR_NOT_WRITING_EMPTY_FILE = 4 # not attempting to save an empty configuration
ERR_CANT_SAVE_CONFIGURATION = 8 # Failed to save the configuration file
ERR_NOT_LOADING_EMPTY_FILE = 16 # not atempting to load an empty config file
ERR_CANT_LOAD = 32 # Cannot load configuration data from file.

INFO_FILE_CREATED = 256 # Information - specified file was created
INFO_FILE_LOADED = 512 # Information - Config file was loaded successfully
{% endhighlight %}

These are generally to do with existence and creation of configuration files.
